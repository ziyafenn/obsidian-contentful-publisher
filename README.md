# Contentful Publisher

Contentful is a headless CMS that lets you create and deliver content to any platform.

The plugin can pull the content types from Contentful and create Obsidian templates based on them. It can also pull all your content entries from Contentful and create notes based on them, organizing them into folders based on the content type.

You can also update the content from Obsidian and push it back to Contentful. If the plugin detects that the content is out of sync (it will check if the content was updated on Contentful), it will warn you and create a copy of the content.

All the fields of the content will be added as frontmatter parameters, except for the title and body. Currently, the plugin will ignore these fields: _RichText_, _ResourceLink_, _Link_, _Object_ and _Location_.

## How to Use

1. Setup plugin from **Settings -> Contentful Publisher**
2. Use "Sync with Contentful" action from the Sidebar to pull your content
3. Once you are done editing a Note, select "Update Contentful Entry" from Command palette(ctrl+p) to update the Contentful Entry from Obsidian
